# Innova Funding challenge for Codeable

This project was created with npx-create-react-app.\
I used tailwinds along with styled components for styles following [this design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/365f16fc-c108-494d-be43-9704dd02da03-630c/).\
All the "data" used is in the fakedata.js file.\
The app is only in mobile view according to the requirements.\
